# Working with Containers Docker and the IBM Cloud Container Registry

This is the guided project by IBM Cognitive Class AI. 

## Aim
This project aims to provide the basic working and applications of Containerization. In this guided project, you will run a Docker image as a container and explore the exciting world of cloud container applications.

In this guided project, you will explore basic cloud container operations and discover how containers support modern cloud application development. A container is a software package that contains application code including libraries and dependencies. Containers are portable, running on desktops, on-premises servers, or the cloud.

You will work with Docker images, and files with code that you execute to build containers and run an image as a container on IBM Cloud. Queries will provide you with information about the instance. You will export your namespace and use it to execute several commands.

This guided project will prepare you to use containers with microservices architecture as a foundation for DevOps cloud application development.

## Docker architecture
Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is Docker Compose, which lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.

## Tools and Technologies Used
1. IBM Skills Network Labs environment
2. Docker Hub
   
## Objectives
By the end of this guided project, you will have accomplished the following:

1. Pull an Image from Docker Hub: Learn how to retrieve Docker images from Docker Hub, the central repository for container images.
2. Run an Image as a Container: Use Docker commands to run images as containers, gaining practical experience in container management.
3. Build an Image using a Dockerfile: Understand the process of creating Docker images from Dockerfiles, which contain a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image.
4. Push an Image to the IBM Cloud Container Registry: Discover how to push your Docker images to the IBM Cloud Container Registry, enabling seamless integration and deployment in the cloud.
5. Use the Docker Command Line Interface (CLI): Get hands-on experience with the Docker CLI, a powerful tool for interacting with Docker and managing containers.

## Conclusion
Containerization is a pivotal technology in modern software development, enhancing portability, scalability, and efficiency. This beginner-friendly project by IBM Cognitive Class AI demystifies the process, providing you with the essential skills to navigate and utilize Docker containers effectively. By completing this guided project, you will be well-prepared to integrate containers into your workflow, leveraging the benefits of microservices architecture for robust and scalable cloud applications.

Embark on this journey and unlock the potential of containerization with Dockerâ€”your gateway to the future of cloud computing.
