# Working-with-Containers-Docker-and-the-IBM-Cloud-Container-Registry
This project aims to provide the basic working and applications of Containerization. In this guided project, you will run a Docker image as a container and explore the exciting world of cloud container applications.

In this guided project, you will explore basic cloud container operations and discover how containers support modern cloud application development. A container is a software package that contains application code including libraries and dependencies. Containers are portable, running on desktops, on-premises servers, or the cloud.

You will work with Docker images, and files with code that you execute to build containers and run an image as a container on IBM Cloud. Queries will provide you with information about the instance. You will export your namespace and use it to execute several commands.

This guided project will prepare you to use containers with microservices architecture as a foundation for DevOps cloud application development.

Tools and Technologies Used:
1. IBM Skills Network Labs environment
2. Docker Hub
