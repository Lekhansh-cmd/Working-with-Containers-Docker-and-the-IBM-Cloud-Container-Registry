# Working with Containers Docker and the IBM Cloud Container Registry

This is the guided project by IBM Cognitive Class AI. 

## Aim
This project aims to provide the basic working and applications of Containerization. In this guided project, you will run a Docker image as a container and explore the exciting world of cloud container applications.

In this guided project, you will explore basic cloud container operations and discover how containers support modern cloud application development. A container is a software package that contains application code including libraries and dependencies. Containers are portable, running on desktops, on-premises servers, or the cloud.

You will work with Docker images, and files with code that you execute to build containers and run an image as a container on IBM Cloud. Queries will provide you with information about the instance. You will export your namespace and use it to execute several commands.

This guided project will prepare you to use containers with microservices architecture as a foundation for DevOps cloud application development.

## Docker architecture
Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.

## Tools and Technologies Used
1. IBM Skills Network Labs environment
2. Docker Hub
   
## Objectives

Take a look at the basic objectives of this guided project provided by IBM Cognitive Class.
1. Pull an image from the Docker Hub
2. Run an image as a container using the docker
3. Build an image using a Dockerfile
4. Push an image to the IBM Cloud Container Registry
5. Use the Docker command line interface (CLI)
